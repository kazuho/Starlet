NAME
    Starlet - a simple, high-performance PSGI/Plack HTTP server

SYNOPSIS
      % start_server --port=80 -- plackup -s Starlet [options] your-app.psgi

      or if you do not need hot deploy,

      % plackup -s Starlet --port=80 [options] your-app.psgi

DESCRIPTION
    Starlet is a standalone HTTP/1.1 web server, formerly known as
    Plack::Server::Standalone::Prefork and
    Plack::Server::Standalone::Prefork::Server::Starter.

    The server supports following features, and is suitable for running HTTP
    application servers behind a reverse proxy.

    - prefork and graceful shutdown using Parallel::Prefork

    - hot deploy using Server::Starter

    - fast HTTP processing using HTTP::Parser::XS (optional)

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
    In addition to the options supported by plackup, Starlet accepts
    following options(s).

  --max-workers=#
    number of worker processes (default: 10)

  --timeout=#
    seconds until timeout (default: 300)

  --keepalive-timeout=#
    timeout for persistent connections (default: 2)

  --max-keepalive-reqs=#
    max. number of requests allowed per single persistent connection. If set
    to one, persistent connections are disabled (default: 1)

  --max-reqs-per-child=#
    max. number of requests to be handled before a worker process exits
    (default: 100)

  --min-reqs-per-child=#
    if set, randomizes the number of requests handled by a single worker
    process between the value and that supplied by "--max-reqs-per-chlid"
    (default: none)

  --spawn-interval=#
    if set, worker processes will not be spawned more than once than every
    given seconds. Also, when SIGHUP is being received, no more than one
    worker processes will be collected every given seconds. This feature is
    useful for doing a "slow-restart". See
    http://blog.kazuhooku.com/2011/04/web-serverstarter-parallelprefork.html
    for more information. (dedault: none)

NOTES
    Starlet is designed and implemented to be simple, secure and fast,
    especially for running as a HTTP application server running behind a
    reverse proxy. It only depends on a minimal number of well-designed (and
    well-focused) modules.

    On the other hand if you are looking for a standalone preforking HTTP
    server that receives HTTP requests directly from the Internet, then you
    should look at Starman.
